Theme-Park-Ticketing-System
This is a python code using Tkinter as the GUI and sqlite3 as the database.

This program has 4 main functions:
1. Add a new ticket transaction
2. Modify an existing ticket transaction
3. View all the ticket transactions
4. Delete an existing ticket transaction

Things that I have learned:
1. how to use Tkinter, sqlite3 and ImageTk
2. subfunctioning in a function
3. destroying the previous, unused windows to keep the screen unclustered

Things to Improve:
1. struggling to valid the date so that the selected date is not earlier than the current date
2. wish that the program looked nicer
3. feel like there was a lot of repetition in the code
4. struggle to add video to the code
